The design and the colour of Guyana Flag are interpreted as follows - The green background symbolises the agricultural and forested nature of Guyana. The white symbolises its waters and rivers potential. The golden arrow symbolises Guyana’s mineral wealth and its forward thrust. The black border the endurance that will sustain the golden arrow’s forward thrust into the future. The red triangle represents the zeal and dynamic nature of the nation building that lies before this young and independent country. The Flag is designed to be of a proportion 3* 5 on land and 1* 2 at sea. The colour proportions are: green 50\" gold 24\" white 67\" and black 1\". GUYANA COAT-OF-ARMS The design of Guyana’s Coat of Arms is interpreted as follows:- The Amerindian head-dress, the Cacique Crown, symbolises the Amerindians as the indigenous people of the country. The two diamonds at the sides of the head-dress represent the country’s mining industry. The helmet, on which the Cacique Crown rests, is the monarchical insignia. The two jaguars rampant, holding a pick-axe, a sugar cane, and a stalk of rice, symbolise labour and the two main agricultural industries of the country, sugar and rice. The shield which is decorated with the national flower, the Victoria Regia Lily, is to protect the nation. The three blue wavy barrulets represent the three great 263 rivers and many waters of Guyana. The Canje Pheasant at the bottom of the shield is a rare bird found principally in this part of the world, and represents the rich fauna of Guyana. GUYANA NATIONAL ANTHEM Dear land of Guyana, of rivers and plains made rich by the sunshine and lush by the rains; Set gem-like and fair, between mountains and sea, Your children salute you, dear land of the free. Green land of Guyana, our heroes of yore; Both bondsmen and free, laid their bones on your shore; This soil they so hallowed, and from them are we, All sons of one mother, Guyana the free. Great land of Guyana, diverse though our strains, We are born of their sacrifice, heirs of their pains, And ours is the glory their eyes did not see One land of six peoples, united and free. Dear land of Guyana, to you will we give our homage, our service, each day that we live; God guard you, great Mother, and make us to be More worthy our heritage - land of the free. THE NATIONAL PLEDGE I pledge myself to honour always the flag of Guyana, and to be loyal to my country, to be obedient to the laws of Guyana, to love my fellow citizens, and to dedicate my energies towards the happiness and prosperity of Guyana. __________________ 265 Article 222A Article 154A, 212O(1) THIRD SCHEDULE ENTITIES The Ethnic Relations Commission The Human Rights Commission The Women and Gender Equality Commission The Indigenous Peoples’ Commission The Rights of the Child Commission The Judiciary The Office of the Auditor General. __________________ FOURTH SCHEDULE CONVENTIONS Convention on the Rights of the Child.
