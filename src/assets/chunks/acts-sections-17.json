(3) On being satisfied that a case of abuse of the monopoly rights under a patent has been established, the Registrar may exercise any of the following powers as he may deem expedient in the circumstances: (a) he may order the patent to be endorsed with the words “licences of right” and thereupon the same rules shall apply as are provided in this Act in respect of patents so endorsed, and an exercise by the Registrar of this power shall entitle every existing licensee to apply to the Registrar for an order entitling him to surrender his licence in exchange for a licence to be settled by the Registrar in like manner as if the patent had been so endorsed at the request of the patentee, and the Registrar may make such order; and an order that a patent be so endorsed may be made notwithstanding that there may be an agreement subsisting which would have precluded the endorsement of the patent at the request of the patentee; (b) he may order the grant to the applicant of a licence on such terms as the Registrar may think expedient, including a term precluding the licensee from importing into Guyana any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 53 L.R.O. 1/2012 patentee or persons claiming under him, would be an infringement of the patent, and in such case the patentee and all licensees for the time being shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against such importation. A licensee under this paragraph shall be entitled to call upon the patentee to take proceedings to prevent infringement of the patent, and if the patentee refuses, or neglects to do so within two months after being so called upon, the licensee may institute proceedings for infringement in his own name as though he were the patentee, making the patentee a defendant. A patentee so added as defendant shall not be liable for any costs unless he enters an appearance and takes part in the proceedings. Service on him may be effected by leaving the writ at his address for service given on the register. In settling the terms of a licence under this paragraph the Registrar shall be guided as far as may be by the same considerations as are specified in section 28 for his guidance in settling licences under that section; (c) if the Registrar is satisfied that the invention is not being worked on a commercial scale in Guyana, and is such that it cannot be so worked without the expenditure of capital for the raising of which it will be necessary to rely on the patent monopoly, he may, unless the patentee or those claiming under him will undertake to find such capital, LAWS OF GUYANA 54 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs L.R.O. 1/2012 order the grant to the applicant, or any other person, or to the applicant and any other person or persons jointly, if able and willing to provide such capital, of an exclusive licence on such terms as the Registrar may think just, but subject as hereinafter provided; (d) if the Registrar is satisfied that the monopoly rights have been abused in the circumstances specified in paragraph (f) of the last preceding subsection, he may order the grant of licences to the applicant and to such of his customers and containing such terms as the Registrar may think expedient; (e) if the Registrar is of opinion that objects of this section will be best attained by making no order under the above provisions of this section, he may make an order refusing the application and dispose of any question as to costs thereon as he thinks just. (4) In settling the terms of any such exclusive licence as is provided in paragraph (c) of the last preceding subsection, due regard shall be had to the risks undertaken by the licensee in providing the capital and working the invention, but, subject thereto, the licence shall be so framed as— (a) to secure to the patentee the maximum royalty compatible with the licensee working the invention in Guyana on a commercial scale and LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 55 L.R.O. 1/2012 at a reasonable profit; (b) to guarantee to the patentee a minimum yearly sum by way of royalty, if and so far as it is reasonable so to do, having regard to the capital requisite for the proper working of the invention and all the circumstances of the case; and, in addition to any other powers expressed in the licence or order, the licence and the order granting the licence shall be made revocable at the discretion of the Registrar if the licensee fails to expend the amount specified in the licence as being the amount which he is able and willing to provide for the purpose of working the invention on a commercial scale within Guyana, or if he fails so to work the invention within the time specified in the order. (5) In deciding to whom such an exclusive licence is to be granted the Registrar shall, unless good reason is shown to the contrary, prefer an existing licensee to a person having no registered interest in the patent. (6) The order granting an exclusive licence under this section shall operate to take away from the patentee any right which he may have as patentee to work or use the invention and to revoke all existing licences, unless otherwise provided in the order, but on granting an exclusive licence the Registrar may, if he thinks it fair and equitable, make it a condition that the licensee shall give proper compensation to be fixed by the Registrar for any money or labour expended by the patentee or any existing licensee in developing or exploiting the invention. (7) If an application is made under subsection (1) in relation to a patent, and— LAWS OF GUYANA 56 Cap. 90:03 Patents and Designs L.R.O. 1/2012 (a) an order has already been made in relation to that patent under subsection (3) (b), (c) or (d); (b) a period of not less than two years has elapsed between the date of that order and the date of the application; and (c) the Registrar is satisfied that the objects of this section cannot be attained by the exercise of any of the powers conferred by the said subsection (3), the Registrar may order the patent to be revoked, either forthwith or after such reasonable interval as may be specified in the order, unless in the meantime such conditions as may be prescribed in the order with a view to attaining the objects of this section are fulfilled and the Registrar may, on reasonable cause shown in any case, by subsequent order extend the interval so specified: Provided that the Registrar shall make no order for revocation which is at variance with any treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement subsisting between Guyana and any Commonwealth territory or any foreign country. (8) Every application presented to the Registrar under this section must set out fully the nature of the applicant’s interest and the facts upon which the applicant bases his case and the relief which he seeks. The application must be accompanied by statutory declarations verifying the applicant’s interest and the facts set out in the application. (9) The Registrar shall consider the matters alleged in the application and declarations, and, if satisfied that the applicant has a bona fide interest and that a prima facie case for relief has been made out, he shall direct the applicant to serve copies of the application and declarations LAWS OF GUYANA Patents and Designs Cap. 90:03 57 L.R.O. 1/2012 upon the patentee and upon any other persons appearing from the register to be interested in the patent and shall advertise the application in the Gazette. (10) If the patentee or any person is desirous of opposing the granting of any relief under this section, he shall, within such time as may be prescribed or within such extended time as the Registrar may on application (made either before or after the expiration of the prescribed time) further allow, deliver to the Registrar a counter statement verified by a statutory declaration fully setting out the grounds on which the application is to be opposed. (11) The Registrar shall consider the counter statement and declarations in support thereof and may thereupon dismiss the application if satisfied that the allegations in the application have been adequately answered, unless any of the parties demands a hearing or unless the Registrar himself appoints a hearing. In any case the Registrar may require the attendance before him of any of the declarants to be cross-examined or further examined upon matters relevant to the issues raised in the application and counter statement, and he may, subject to due precautions against disclosure of information to rivals in trade, require the production before him of books and documents relating to the matter in issue. (12) All orders of the Registrar under this section shall be subject to appeal to the Court, and on any such appeal the Attorney- General or such other counsel as he may appoint shall be entitled to appear and be heard.
