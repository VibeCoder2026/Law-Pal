To obtain such recognition or enforcement it shall, further, be necessary— (a) That the award has been made in pursuance of a submission to arbitration which is valid under the law applicable thereto; (b) That the subject-matter of the award is capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of the country in which the award is sought to be relied upon; (c) That the award has been made by the Arbitral Tribunal provided for in the submission to arbitration or constituted in the manner agreed upon by the parties and in conformity with the law governing the arbitration procedure; (d) That the award has become final in the country in which it has been made, in the sense that it will not be considered as such if it is open to opposition appel or pourvoi en cassation (in the countries where such forms of procedure exist) or if it is proved that any proceedings for the purpose of contesting the validity of the award are pending; (e) That the recognition or enforcement of the award is not contrary to the public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in which it is sought to be relied upon.

If the award has not covered all the questions submitted to the arbitral tribunal, the competent authority of the country where recognition or enforcement of the award is sought can, if it think fit, postpone such recognition or enforcement or grant it subject to such guarantee as that authority may decide. ARTICLE 3 If the party against whom the award has been made proves that, under the law governing the arbitration procedure, there is a ground, other than the grounds referred to in Article 1 (a) and (c) and Article 2 (b) and (c), entitling him to contest the validity of the award in a Court of Law, the Court may, if it thinks fit either refuse recognition or enforcement of the award or adjourn the consideration L.R.O. 1/2012 LAWS OF GUYANA Arbitration Cap. 7:03 23 thereof, giving such party a reasonable time within which to have the award annulled by the competent tribunal.
