This Section shall apply not only to currency subscribed by members but also to any currency otherwise due to, or acquired by, the Fund and to be placed in the General Resources Account. ARTICLE IV OBLIGATIONS REGARDING EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS Section 1. General obligations of members Recognizing that the essential purpose of the international monetary system is to provide a framework that facilitates the exchange of goods, services, and capital among countries, and that sustains sound economic growth, and that a principal objective is the continuing development of the orderly underlying conditions that are necessary for financial and economic stability, each member undertakes to collaborate with the Fund and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and to promote a stable system of exchange rates In particular each member shall: (i) endeavour to direct its economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 17 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 stability, with clue regard to its circumstances; (ii) seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions and a monetary system that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions; (iii) avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members; and (iv) follow exchange policies compatible with the undertakings under this Section. Section 2. General exchange arrangements (a) Each member shall notify the Fund, within thirty days after the date of the second amendment of this Agreement of the exchange arrangements it intends to apply in fulfillment of its obligations under Section 1 of this Article, and shall notify the Fund promptly of any changes in its exchange arrangements. (b) Under an international monetary system of the kind prevailing on LAWS OF GUYANA 18 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 January 1, 1976, exchange arrangements may include— (i) the maintenance by a member of a value for its currency in terms of the special drawing right or another denominator other than gold, selected by the member, or (ii) co-operative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, or (iii) other exchange arrangements of a member’s choice. (c) To accord with the development of the international monetary system, the Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may make provision for general exchange arrangements without limiting the right of members to have exchange arrangements of their choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and the obligations under Section 1 of this Article. Section 3. Surveillance over exchange arrangements (a) The Fund shall oversee the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation, and shall oversee the compliance of each member with its obligations LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 19 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 under Section I of this Article. (b) In order to fulfill its functions under (a) above, the Fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies. Each member shall provide the Fund with the information necessary for such surveillance, and, when requested by the Fund, shall consult with it on the member’s exchange rate policies. The principles adopted by the Fund shall be consistent with co- operative arrangements by which members maintain the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, as well as with other exchange arrangements of a member’s choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and Section 1 of this Article. These principles shall respect the domestic social and political policies of members, and in applying these principles the Fund shall pay due regard to the circumstances of members. Section 4. Par values The Fund may determine by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, that international economic conditions permit the introduction of a widespread system of exchange arrangements based on stable but adjustable par values. The Fund shall make the determination on the basis of the underlying stability of the LAWS OF GUYANA 20 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 world economy, and for this purpose shall take into account price movements and rates of expansion in the economies of members. The determination shall be made in light of the evolution of the international monetary system, with particular reference to sources of liquidity, and in order to ensure the effective operation of a system of par values, to arrangements under which both members in surplus and members in deficit in their balances of payments take prompt, effective, and symmetrical action to achieve adjustment, as well as to arrangements for intervention and the treatment of imbalances. Upon making such determination, the Fund shall notify members that the provisions of Schedule C apply. Section 5. Separate currencies within a member’s territories (a) Action by a member with respect to its currency under this Article shall be deemed to apply to the separate currencies of all territories in respect of which the member has accepted this Agreement under Article XXXI, Section 2(g) unless the member declares that its action relates either to the metropolitan currency alone or only to one or more specified separate currencies or to the metropolitan currency and one or more specified separate currencies.

ARTICLE XVIII ALLOCATION AND CANCELLATION OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS Section 1. Principles and considerations governing allocation and cancellation (a) In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and cancellation of special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to meet the long-term global need, as LAWS OF GUYANA 78 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets in such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will avoid economic stagnation and deflation as well as excess demand and inflation in the world. (b) The first decision to allocate special drawing rights shall take into account, as special considerations, a collective judgment that there is a global need to supplement reserves and the attainment of a better balance of payments equilibrium, as well as the likelihood of a better working of the adjustment process in the future. Section 2. Allocation anal cancellation (a) Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing rights shall be made for basic periods which shall run consecutively and shall be five years in duration. The first basic period shall begin on the date of the first decision to allocate special drawing rights or such later date as may be specified in that decision. Any allocations or cancellations shall take place at yearly intervals. (b) The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be expressed as percentages of quotas on the date of each decision to allocate. The rates at which special drawing rights are to be cancelled shall be expressed as percentages of net cumulative LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 79 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 allocations of special drawing rights on the date of each decision to cancel. The percentages shall be the same for all participants. (c) In its decision for any basic period the fund may provide, notwithstanding (a) and (b) above, that: (i) the duration of the basic period shall be other than five years; or (ii) the allocations or cancellations shall take place at other than yearly intervals; or (iii) the basis for allocations or cancellations shall be the quotas or net cumulative allocations on dates other than the dates of decisions to allocate or cancel. (d) A member that becomes a participant after a basic period starts shall receive allocations beginning with the next basic period in which allocations are made after it becomes a participant unless the Fund decides that the new participant shall start to receive allocations beginning with the next allocation after it becomes a participant. If the Fund decides that a member that becomes a participant during a basic period shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic period and the participant was not a member on the dates establish under (b) or (c) above, the Fund shall determine the basis on LAWS OF GUYANA 80 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 which these allocations to the participant shall be made. (e) A participant shall receive allocations of special drawing rights made pursuant to any decision to allocate unless: (i) the Governor for the participant did not vote in favour of the decision; and (ii) the participant has notified the Fund in writing prior to the first allocation of special drawing rights under that decision that it does not wish special drawing rights to be allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a participant, the Fund may decide to terminate the effect of the notice with respect to allocations of special drawing rights subsequent to the termination. (f) If on the effective date of any cancellation the amount of special drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share of special drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the participant shall eliminate its negative balance as promptly as its gross reserve position permits and shall remain in consultation with the Fund for this purpose. Special drawing rights acquired by the participant after the effective date of the LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 81 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 cancellation shall be applied against its negative balance and cancelled. Section 3. Unexpected major developments The Fund may change the rates or intervals of allocation or cancellation during the rest of a basic period or change the length of a basic period or start a new basic period, if at any time the Fund finds it desirable to do so because of unexpected major developments. Section 4. Decisions on allocations and cancellations (a) Decisions under Section 2(a), (b) and (c) or Section 3 of this Article shall be made by the Board of Governors on the basis of proposals of the Managing Director concurred in by the Executive Board. (b) Before making any proposal, the Managing Director, after having satisfied himself that it will be consistent with the provisions of Section 1(a) of this Article, shall conduct such consultations as will enable him to ascertain that there is broad support among participants for the proposal. In addition, before making a proposal for the first allocation, the Managing Director shall satisfy himself that the provisions of Section 1(b) of this Article have been met and that there is broad support among participants to begin allocations: he shall make a proposal for the first allocation as soon after the establishment of the Special Drawing Rights Department LAWS OF GUYANA 82 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 as he is so satisfied. (c) The Managing Director shall make proposals: (i) not later than six months before the end of each basic period; (ii) if no decision has been taken with respect to allocation or cancellation for a basic period, whenever he is satisfied that the provisions of (b) above have been met; (iii) when in accordance Section 3 of this Article, he considers that it would be desirable to change the rate or intervals of allocation or cancellation or change the length of a basic period or start a new basic period; or (iv) within six months of a request by the Board of Governors or the Executive Board: provided that, if under (i), (iii), or (iv) above the Managing Director ascertains that there is no proposal which he considers to be consistent with the provisions of Section 1 of this Article that has broad support among participants in accordance with (b) above, he shall report to the Board of Governors and to the Executive Board. (d) An eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power shall be required for decisions under Section 2(a), (b), and (c) of Section 3 of this Article LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 83 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 except for decisions under Section 3 with respect to a decrease in the rates of allocation.

(c) The Fund, by a seventy per cent majority of the total voting power, may prescribe operations in which a participant is authorized to engage in agreement with another participant on such terms and conditions as the Fund deems appropriate.

(d) The Fund may make representations to a participant that enters into any operation or transaction under (b) or (c) above that in the judgement of the Fund may be prejudiced to the process of designation according to the principles of Section 5 of this Article or is otherwise inconsistent with Article XXII. A participant that persists in entering into such operations or transactions shall be subject to Article XXIII, Section 2(b). Section 3. Requirement of need (a) In transactions under Section 2(a) of this Article, except as otherwise provided in (c) below, a participant will be expected to use its special drawing rights only is it has a need because of its balance of payments or its reserve position or developments in its reserves, and not for the sole purpose of changing the composition of its reserves. (b) The use of special drawing rights shall not be subject to challenge on the basis of the expectation in (a) above, but the Fund may make representations to a participant that fails to fulfil this expectation.

LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 85 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 (c) The Fund may waive the expectation in (a) above in any transactions in which a participant uses special drawing rights to obtain an equivalent amount of currency from a participant designated under Section 5 of this Article that would promote reconstitution by the other participant under Section 6(a) of this Article; prevent or reduce a negative balance of the other participant; or offset the effect of a failure by the other participant to fulfill the expectation in (a) above. Section 4. Obligation to provide currency (a) A participant designated by the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall provide on demand a freely usable currency to a participant using special drawing rights under Section 2(a) of this Article.

(b) A participant may provide currency in excess of the obligatory limit or any agreed higher limit. Section 5. Designation of participants to provide currency (a) The Fund shall ensure that a LAWS OF GUYANA 86 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 participant will be able to use its special drawing rights by designating participants to provide currency for specified amounts of special drawing rights for the purposes of Sections 2(a) and 4 of this Article. Designations shall be made in accordance with the following general principles supplemented by such other principles as the Fund may adopt from time to time. (i) A participant shall be subject to designation if its balance of payments and gross reserve position is sufficiently strong, but this will not preclude the possibility that a participant with a strong reserve position will be designated even though it has a moderate balance of payments deficit. Participants shall be designated in such manner as will promote over time a balance distribution of holdings of special drawing rights among them. (ii) Participants shall be subject to designation in order to promote reconstitution under Section 6(a) of this Article, to reduce negative balances in holdings of special drawing rights, or to offset the effect of failures to fulfill the expectation in Section 3(a) of this Article. (iii) In designating participants, the Fund normally shall give priority to those that need to acquire special drawing rights to meet the objectives of LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 87 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 designation under (ii) above. (b) In order to promote over time a balanced distribution of holdings of special drawing rights under (a) (i) above, the Fund shall apply the rules for designation in Schedule F or such rules as may be adopted under (c) below.

(b) The Fund, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may adopt policies under which in exceptional circumstances the Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power, may authorize participants entering into transactions under Section 2(b) of this Article to agree on exchange rates other than those applicable under (a) above.

(b) The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances when local currency required for the purposes of the loan cannot be raised by the borrower on reasonable terms, provide the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of that currency. (c) The Bank, if the project gives rise indirectly to an increased need for foreign exchange by the member in whose territories the project is located, may in exceptional circumstances provide the borrower as part of the loan with an appropriate amount of gold or foreign exchange not in excess of the LAWS OF GUYANA 164 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 borrower’s local expenditure in connection with the purposes of the loan. (d) The Bank may, in exceptional circumstances, at the request of a member in whose territories a portion of the loan is spent, repurchase with gold or foreign exchange a part of that member’s currency thus spent but in no case shall the part so repurchased exceed the amount by which the expenditure of the loan in those territories gives rise to an increased need for foreign exchange. Section 4. Payment provisions for direct loans Loan contracts under Section l (a) (i) or (ii) of this Article shall be made in accordance with the following payment provisions: (a) The terms and conditions of interest and amortization payments, maturity and dates of payment of each loan shall be determined by the Bank. The Bank shall also determine the rate and any other terms and conditions of commission to be charged in connection with such loan. In the case of loans made under Section 1(a) (ii) of this Article during the first ten years of the Bank’s operations, this rate of commission shall be not less than one per cent per annum and not greater than one and one half per cent per annum, and shall be charged on the outstanding portion of any such loan. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 165 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 to the outstanding portions of loans already made and to future loans, if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable. (b) All loan contracts shall stipulate the currency or currencies in which payments under the contract shall be made to the Bank. At the option of the borrower, however, such payments may be made in gold, or subject to the agreement of the Bank, in the currency of a member other than that prescribed in the contract. (i) In the case of loans made under Section l (a) (i) of this Article the loan contracts shall provide that payments to the Bank of interest, other charges and amortization shall be made in the currency loaned, unless the member whose currency is loaned agrees that such payments shall be made in some other specified currency or currencies. These payments, subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 9 (c), shall be equivalent to the value of such contractual payments at the time the loans were made, in terms of a currency specified for the purpose by the Bank by a three-fourths majority of the LAWS OF GUYANA 166 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 total voting power. (ii) In the case of loans made under Section I (a) (ii) of this Article, the total amount outstanding and payable to the Bank in any one currency shall at no time exceed the total amount of the outstanding borrowings made by the Bank under Section l (a) (ii) and payable in the same currency. (c) If a member suffers from an acute exchange stringency, so that the service of any loan, contracted by that member or guaranteed by it or by one of its agencies cannot be provided in the stipulated manner, the member concerned may apply to the Bank for a relaxation of the conditions of payment. If the Bank is satisfied that some relaxation is in the interests of the particular member and of the operations of the Bank and of its members as a whole, it may take action under either, or both, of the following paragraphs with respect to the whole, or part, of the annual service: (i) The Bank may, in its discretion, make arrangements with the member concerned, to accept service payments on the loan in the member’s currency for periods not to exceed three years upon appropriate terms LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 167 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 regarding the use of such currency and the maintenance of its foreign exchange value; and for the repurchase of such currency on appropriate terms. (ii) The Bank may modify the terms of amortization or extend the life of the loan, or both. Section 5. Guarantees (a) In guaranteeing a loan placed through the usual investment channels, the Bank shall charge a guarantee commission payable periodically on the amount of the loan outstanding at a rate determined by the Bank. During the first ten years of the Bank’s operations, this rate shall be not less than one per cent per annum and not greater than one- half per cent per annum. At the end of this period of ten years, the rate of commission may be reduced by the Bank with respect both to the outstanding portions of loans already guaranteed and to future loans if the reserves accumulated by the Bank under Section 6 of this Article and out of other earnings are considered by it sufficient to justify a reduction. In the case of future loans the Bank shall also have discretion to increase the rate of commission beyond the above limit, if experience indicates that an increase is advisable. LAWS OF GUYANA 168 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 (b) Guarantee commissions shall be paid directly to the Bank by the borrower. (c) Guarantees by the Bank shall provide that the Bank may terminate its liability with respect to interest if, upon default by the borrower and by the guarantor, if any, the Bank offers to purchase, at par and interest accrued to a date designated in the offer, the bonds or other obligations guaranteed. (d) The Bank shall have power to determine any other terms and conditions of the guarantee. Section 6. Special reserve The amount of commissions received by the Bank under Sections 4 and 5 of this article shall be set aside as a special reserve, which shall be kept available for meeting liabilities of the Bank in accordance with Section 7 of this Article. The special reserve shall be held in such liquid form, permitted under this Agreement, as the Executive Directors may decide. Section 7. Methods of meeting liabilities of the Bank in case of defaults In cases of default on loans made, participated in, or guaranteed by the Bank: (a) The Bank shall make such arrangements as may be feasible to adjust the obligations under the loans, including arrangements under or LAWS OF GUYANA International Financial Organisations Cap. 76:01 169 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 analogous to those provided in Section 4(c) of this Article. (b) The payments in discharge of the Bank’s liabilities on borrowings or guarantees under Section I (a) (ii) and (iii) of this Article shall be charged: (i) first, against the special reserve provided in Section 6 of this Article. (ii) then, to the extent necessary and at the discretion of the Bank, against the other reserves, surplus and capital available to the Bank. (c) Whenever necessary to meet contractual payments of interest, other charges or amortization on the Bank’s own borrowings, or to meet the Bank’s liabilities with respect to similar payments on loans guaranteed by it, the Bank may call an appropriate amount of the unpaid subscriptions of members in accordance with Article 11, Sections 5 and 7. Moreover, if it believes that a default may be of long duration, the Bank may call an additional amount of such unpaid subscriptions not to exceed in any one year one per cent of the total subscriptions of the members for the following purposes: (i) To redeem prior to maturity, or otherwise discharge its liability LAWS OF GUYANA 170 Cap. 76:01 International Financial Organisations L.R.O. 1/ 2012 on, all or part of the outstanding principal of any loan guaranteed by it in respect of which the debtor is in default. (ii) To repurchase, or otherwise discharge, its liability on, all or part of its own outstanding borrowings. Section 8. Miscellaneous operations In addition to the operations specified elsewhere in this Agreement, the Bank shall have the power: (i) To buy and sell securities it has issued and to buy and sell securities which it has guaranteed or in which it has invested, provided that the Bank shall obtain the approval of the member in whose territories the securities are to be bought or sold. (ii) To guarantee securities in which it has invested for the purpose of facilitating their sale. (iii) To borrow the currency of any member with the approval of that member.

(2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3), where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business LAWS OF GUYANA Income Tax Cap. 81:01 215 [Subsidiary] Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) Order L.R.O. 1/2012 in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. (3) In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including a reasonable allocation of executive and general administrative expenses incurred for then purposes of the enterprise as a whole, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

(2) Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises dealing at arm's length then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting State shall if necessary consult each other. ARTICLE 11 DIVIDENDS (1) Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

(3) The term \"dividends\" as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt- claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights assimilated to income from shares by the taxation laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident and also includes any other item which, under the laws of the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, is treated as a dividend or distribution of a company.
