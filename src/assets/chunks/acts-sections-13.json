Factors which shall be considered in the issuance of a warning as opposed to a civil penalty may include: toxicity of the pesticide, extent and severity of actual or potential harm to human health or the environment, compliance history and degree of culpability. Warnings shall be generally issued for first-time record- keeping or late-reporting violations. (2) Civil Penalties: The Registrar shall use administrative enforcement proceedings to assess civil penalties in response to most violations of the Act. Section 34 of the Act establishes penalties for violations of the LAWS OF GUYANA Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Cap. 68:09 187 [Subsidiary] Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . Act. The Registrar will seek civil penalties for violations that— (i) present an actual or potential risk of human or environmental harm or impede the Registrar’s ability to fulfill the goals of the Act, (ii) were committed as a result of ordinary negligence, inadvertence or mistake, (iii) by either— (a) a registrant, commercial applicator, “for hire” applicator, wholesaler or dealer, retailer or distributor, or (b) a private applicator or other person not listed above, but who has received a prior written warning or citation for a violation of the Act. The Registrar may not assess penalties without notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the alleged violation. The amount of a civil penalty will depend upon— (a) gravity or level of the violation (b) size of the business (c) toxicity of the pesticide, actual or potential harm to the environment or health, compliance history of the violator and the violator’s level of culpability (d) violator’s ability to pay and continue in business (e) voluntary disclosure by the violator and his ‘good faith’. (3) Stop Sale, Use or Removal Orders: The Registrar may issue a “Stop Sale”, a “Stop LAWS OF GUYANA 188 Cap. 68:09 Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control [Subsidiary] Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 Use” or a “Removal Order” to any person who owns, controls or has custody of a pesticide that: (i) a Registrar Inspector has reason to believe on the basis of tests or inspection is in violation of any provision of the Act or its regulations, (ii) has been or is intended to be distributed or sold in violation of the Act or its regulations, or (iii) has a cancelled or suspended registration. After receipt of one of these orders, a person shall not sell, use, or remove the pesticides except in accordance with a Registrar order. A “Stop Sale”, a “Stop Use” or a “Removal Order” shall be issued for— (a) pesticides for which there is reason to believe that there is a potential hazard to man or the environment because— (i) they are not registered or are so over- formulated, under-formulated or adulterated so as to present a serious health hazard, (ii) they are packaged in improper or damaged containers, or are so inadequately labelled as to make safe or effective use unlikely or impossible; (b) pesticides with labelling that is materially misleading or fraudulent and, if followed by a user, is likely to cause a life-endangering health hazard or serious adverse, environmental effects; (c) pesticides that are in violation of the Act and are the subject of a recall, but which the individual refuses to remove, is recalcitrant in removing or is unable to remove from trade; LAWS OF GUYANA Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Cap. 68:09 189 [Subsidiary] Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 (d) pesticides that are in violation of the Act and for which a civil penalty has been issued, but which have not been brought into compliance; (e) pesticides which have been suspended. The Registrar may issue a “Stop Sale”, a “Stop Use” or a “Removal Order” for less grave situations, for example, for repeated or continued minor violations or where several minor violations appear on a label. Where the Registrar suspects that a violation has already occurred, the Registrar shall assess civil penalties along with the “Stop Sale”, a “Stop Use” or a “Removal Order”. (4) Seizure: The Registrar may initiate seizure of a pesticide that is being transported or, having been transported, remains unsold or in original, unbroken packages. The Registrar may also seize a pesticide if it is adulterated or misbranded, unregistered, inadequately labelled, inadequately coloured or the subject of claims or directions for use that differ in substance from those made with its registration. The Registrar may also seek seizure of a pesticide that causes unreasonable adverse environmental effects even when used in accordance with the Act and the pesticide product’s labelling. The circumstances in which the Registrar may initiate a seizure generally overlap with those in which it may issue a “Stop Sale”, a “Stop Use” or a “Removal Order”. Because an order is easier to obtain than a seizure and often provides a greater degree of flexibility, the Registrar will generally initiate a seizure only in circumstances where an order would be ineffective or inadequate. LAWS OF GUYANA 190 Cap. 68:09 Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control [Subsidiary] Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 (5) Injunction: The Registrar may seek a permanent injunction, preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to ensure compliance with the Act. To obtain a permanent injunction the Registrar must demonstrate to the court that other administrative or judicial remedies are inadequate to restrain the violation or prevent unreasonable risk to the public health or the environment, that it has diligently pursued all other appropriate administrative remedies yet the violation continues, or that irreparable injury, damage, loss or damage will result unless a court grants injunctive relief. (6) Criminal Proceedings: The Registrar may seek criminal penalties for grave and deliberate violations of the Act. Criminal violations of the Act may also violate other laws. ___________________ First Schedule Prohibited Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals The chemicals listed hereunder has been classified by the Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Board as prohibited— ______________________ LAWS OF GUYANA Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Cap. 68:09 191 [Subsidiary] Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 Second Schedule Restricted Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals The chemicals listed hereunder has been classified by the Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals Control Board as restricted— ________________________ Reg. 135A [5/2007] Third Schedule Fee Structure for Pesticides and Toxic Chemicals TYPE OF FEE FEE Application Fee for Import Licence.

(3) Hazard analysis step 3: Identify the potential process related hazards and record in column 3 Using the confirmed flow diagram as a guide, the team should list all potential process related hazards that may be reasonably expected to occur at each process step (including acquisition and storage of raw materials and ingredients and delay) during manufacture. (4) Hazard analysis step 4: Understand the potential hazards. Hazard analysis requires two essential ingredients— (a) The first is an appreciation of the hazard (e.g. pathogenic organism) or any disease agent that could harm the consumer, and, (b) The second is a detailed understanding of how these hazards could arise, thus the hazard analysis requires thorough microbiological, toxicological knowledge in combination with epidemiological and technical information. (5) Hazard analysis step 5: Determine if the potential hazard is significant (risk assessment) and record in LAWS OF GUYANA Fisheries Cap. 71:08 357 [Subsidiary] Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012 column 3 and 4. (a) A hazard is significant if the hazard is: (i) reasonably likely to occur and (ii) if not properly controlled, it is likely to result as an unacceptable health risk to consumers. (6) Hazard analysis step 6: Identify preventive measures and record in column 5— Consider and describe what preventive measures, if any, exist which can be applied for each hazard. (a) preventive measures are those actions and activities that can be used to prevent hazards, eliminate them or reduce their impact or occurrence to acceptable levels. (b) more than one preventive measure may be required to control an identified hazard and more than one hazard may be controlled by one control measure. For instance, pasteurisation or controlled heat treatment may provide sufficient assurance of reduction of the level of both Salmonella and Listeria. (c) preventive measures need to be supported by detailed procedures and specifications to ensure their effective implementation. For instance, precise heat treatment specifications, maximum concentrations of LAWS OF GUYANA 358 Cap. 71:08 Fisheries [Subsidiary] Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012 Schedule No. 9. preservatives used in compliance with the applicable legislation on additives. (7) Hazard analysis step 7: (= principle 2) Identify the critical control point (CCP) and record in column 6 (a) a CCP may be a location, a point, a procedure or processing step in the process flow where by taking preventive measures, effective control can be installed and a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level. (b) the identification of a critical point for the control of a hazard requires a logical approach. Such approach can be facilitated by the use of the decision tree set forth in Schedule 9 to these, Regulations (other methods can be used by the team, according to their knowledge and experience). (c) for the application of the decision tree, each process step identified in the flow diagram should be considered in sequence. At each step, the decision tree must be applied to each hazard that may be reasonably expected to occur or be introduced and each control measure identified. (d) application of the decision tree should be flexible and requires common sense, having consideration for the whole manufacturing process in order to avoid, whenever possible, unnecessary critical points.

In particular, if a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for product safety and no control measure exists at that step or at any other, then the product or process should be modified at that step, or later stage, to include a control measure. If the hazard analysis reveals that processors have food safety hazards that they might control a safety assurance plan (HACCP Plan has to be implemented).

(c) Enter the preventive measures in column 3 of the HACCP plan form. (3) HACCP plan step 3: Set up the critical factors (parameters) and critical limits for each preventive measure associated with each CCP (principle 3). (a) Each control measure associated with critical control points should give rise to the specification of critical limits. (b) Those critical limits correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. They separate acceptability from unacceptability. They are set for observable or measurable parameters that can readily demonstrate that the critical point is under control, they should be based on substantiated evidence that chosen values will result in process control. (c) Examples of such parameters include temperature, time, pH, moisture level, additive, preservative or salt level, sensory parameters such as visual appearance or texture, etc. (d) In some cases, to reduce the risk of exceeding a critical limit due to LAWS OF GUYANA 362 Cap. 71:08 Fisheries [Subsidiary] Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012 process variations, it may be necessary to specify more stringent levels (i.e. target levels) to assure that critical limits are observed, (e) Critical limits may be derived from a variety of sources. When not taken from regulatory standards (e.g. frozen storage temperature) or from existing and validated guides of best practices, the team should ascertain their validity relative to the control of identified hazard and critical points. (4) HACCP plan step 4: Establish a monitoring procedure (principle 4) (a) An essential part of own-checks is a programme of observations or measurements performed at each critical point to ensure compliance with specified critical limits. The programme should describe the methods, the frequency of observations or measurements and the recording procedure. (b) Observations or measurements must be able to detect loss of control at critical points and provide information in time for corrective action to be taken. (c) Observations or measurements can be made continuously or discontinuously. When observations or measurements are not continuous, it is necessary to LAWS OF GUYANA Fisheries Cap. 71:08 363 [Subsidiary] Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012 establish a frequency of observations or measurements, which provides reliable information. (d) The programme of observations or measurements should properly identify for each critical point: (i) what will be monitored (column 4) (ii) how monitoring and checking is performed (column 5) (iii) when monitoring and checking is performed, and (column 6) (iv) who is to perform monitoring and checking (column 7) (5) HACCP plan step 5: Establish a corrective action plan (principle 5) Establish corrective actions in case a deviation from a critical limit occurs. (a) Observations or measurements may indicate. (i) that the parameter monitored tends to deviate its specified critical limits, indicating a trend toward loss of control. Appropriate corrective action to maintain control must be taken before the occurrence of hazard, and (ii) that the parameter monitored LAWS OF GUYANA 364 Cap. 71:08 Fisheries [Subsidiary] Fishery Products Regulations L.R.O 1/2012 has deviated from its specified critical limits, indicating a loss of control. It is necessary to take appropriate corrective action to regain control. (b) Corrective action has to be planned in advance by the multidisciplinary team, for each critical point so that it can be taken without hesitation when a deviation is observed. (c) Such corrective action should include (i) proper identification of the person(s) responsible for the implementation of the corrective action; (ii) description of means and action re-quired to correct the observed deviation; (iii) action to be taken with regard to products that have been manufactured during the period when the process was out of control; and (iv) written record of measures taken.

Who is responsible for keeping the records should be clear at all times.

It shall be constructed to the dimensions herein specified within the limits of accuracy prescribed by the tolerances set forth below. The Oil Cup The oil cup consists of a cylindrical vessel open at the top and fitted on the outside with a flat circular flange projecting at right angles. Within the cup, fixed through the wall and silver soldered or brazed in place, there is a gauge consisting of a piece of wire bent upwards and terminating in a point. Material.

The downward projecting rim is made solid with the top or silver soldered or brazed in place. Upon the cover are mounted a thermometer socket, trunnions to support an oil-test lamp, a pair of guides in which a slide moves, and a white bead. The top of the cover is pierced by three rectangular holes symmetrically placed on a diameter, one in the centre and the other two as close as practicable to the inner sides of the cover- rim and opposite each other. These three holes are covered or uncovered by means of a slide moving in suitably disposed guides. The slide has two perforations, one corresponding in all particulars to the centre hole in the cover and the other to one of the holes at the side. The movement of the slide is restricted by suitable stops, and its length and the disposition of the holes are such that, at the outer extremity of the movement of the slide, the holes in the cover are simultaneously just completely opened and at the inner extremity of the movement of the slide they are completely closed. The trunnions supporting the test-lamp are fixed on the top of the grades and the lamp is mounted in the trunnions so that it is free to oscillate. The lamp is provided with a jet to contain a wick and is so arranged that when the slide is moved LAWS OF GUYANA 20 Cap. 92:01 Petroleum L.R.O. 1/2012 so as to uncover the holes, the oscillating lamp is caught by a pin fixed in the slide and tilted over the central hole in such a way that the lower edge of the cover bisects the circle formed by the bore of the jet when in the lowest position. The flame then occupies a central position within the hole in both directions. A suitably mounted gasket may be substituted for the lamp. The thermometer socket is in the form of a split tube, mounted on a diameter at right angles to the diameter through the centres of the holes, and fitted at such an angle as to bring the bulb of the thermometer, when in place, vertically below the centre of the cover and at the correct distance from it. A white bead, the dimensions of which represent the size of test flame to be used, is mounted in a visible position on the cover. Material. All parts excepting bead, brass or gun-metal. Bead, ivory or other suitable material. LAWS OF GUYANA Petroleum Cap. 92:01 21 L.R.O. 1/2012 Cover Fitted with Stirrer Provision may be made in the cover for the reception of a stirrer which projects into the oil cup, for use with viscous materials only. A bush is mounted on the cover in a position diametrically opposite the thermometer mounting and its length is such and it is set at such an angle that the stirrer rod clears the oil-level gauge and the blades operate below the level of and without fouling the thermometer bulb. The bush is placed as near as practicable to the outer edge of the cover. Dimension.
