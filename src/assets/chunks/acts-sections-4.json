The automatic nature of the manufacturing processes lends itself very well to consistent checking of production, and it was therefore decided, that the most practical way in which control could be exercised and a standard product be maintained was by methods of test for application in the works, which would ensure that the product complied with specific requirements and any departure therefrom would be detected and could be dealt with quickly. The limits imposed by the specification are, in most cases, related to the average hourly test results accumulated over a period of one day. LAWS OF GUYANA Guyana National Bureau of Standards Cap. 90:16 73 [Subsidiary] Guyana National Bureau of Standards (Compulsory Standard Specifications) Order L.R.O. 1/2012 In the normal course of determining a daily average the manufacturer will individually examine over 2,000 matches. Test results based on smaller samples must inevitably show wider fluctuations and will, occasionally, record faults in excess of the limits laid down by the specification as applying exclusively to the daily average. For this reason effective methods of test by the purchaser are impracticable and will provide misleading results unless the size of the sample tested is of a similar order to that examined by the manufacturer in the determination of his daily average. The Jamaican Bureau of Standards will itself make periodical checks where the manufacturer becomes a licensee under the certification mark scheme involving the use of the Bureau's Standard Mark. It must be clearly understood that with an article so small and manufactured in such vast quantities from a naturally variable material, it is impossible to ensure that none of the specified defects will occur, but it is also certain that if the test methods are applied during manufacture the failures will be kept to a minimum and they are likely to be substantially less than they otherwise would be. Some faults covered are of rare occurrence and the majority very infrequent.

The number of splints which break when struck as indicated above, shall not exceed five out of every 100 matches tested. (ii) Heads which drop hot ash (applicable to Safety, Strike-anywhere and Book matches). During the striking tests the matches shall be held over a sheet of white paper.

(iii) Heads which 'shoot' or explode (applicable to Safety, Strike-anywhere and Book matches). During the striking tests, a record shall be made of heads which burn, violently, scattering hot particles, or explode on striking on the friction paint, or sandstrip provided, when employing the minimum pressure necessary to secure ignition. The daily number of matches that yield a positive result shall not exceed one out of every 100 matches tested. (iv) Transfer of flame from the match head to the splint (applicable to Safety, Strike-anywhere and Book matches). After striking as described in subparagraph 8a the match shall be immediately held in a horizontal position clear of the box, in a draught- free atmosphere.

The inner tray shall not drop out under the weight of its contents. The daily number of boxes failing this test shall not exceed one out of every 100 tested. (c) Friction paint (applicable to Safety and Book matches). Four of the twelve boxes and four books employed in the previous tests shall be selected at random for the testing of the wearing properties and non-ignition of the friction paint. (i) Wearing properties. It shall be possible to strike the contents of the box or book on half the area of friction paint provided. The daily number of boxes or books failing this test shall not exceed one. (ii) Non-ignition. During the carrying out of the foregoing test for wearing properties of the friction paint, the paint shall not take fire and burn following striking of a match.

The daily number of such failures shall not exceed one. (d) Sandstrip (applicable to Strike- anywhere matches). Four of the twelve boxes employed in previous tests shall be selected at random and tested for wearing properties of the sandstrip as follows: It shall be possible to strike the contents of the box on half the area of sandstrip provided. The daily number of boxes failing this test shall not exceed one.
