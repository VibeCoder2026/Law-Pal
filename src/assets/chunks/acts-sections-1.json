The principle set out in paragraph (e) above is overriding and applicable in all cases. Within that principle the following Rules are put forward as a guide to police officers conducting investigations. Non-conformity with these Rules may render answers and statements liable to be excluded from evidence in subsequent criminal proceedings. RULES I. When a police officer is trying to discover whether, or by whom, an offence has been committed he is entitled to question any person, whether suspected or not, from whom he thinks that useful information may be obtained. This is so whether or not the person in question has been taken into custody so long as he has not been charged with the offence or informed that he may be prosecuted for it. II. As soon as a police officer has evidence which would afford reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed an offence, he shall caution that person or cause him to be cautioned before putting to him any questions, or further questions, relating to that offence. The caution shall be in the following terms— \"You are not obliged to say anything unless you Judges’ Rules 48 High Court LAWS OF GUYANA Cap. 3:02 [Subsidiary] L.R.O. 1/2012 wish to do so but what you say may be put into writing and given in evidence.\" When after being cautioned a person is being questioned, or elects to make a statement, a record shall be kept of the time and at which any such questioning or statement began and ended and of the persons present. III. (a) Where a person is charged with or informed that he may be prosecuted for an offence he shall be cautioned in the following terms— \"Do you wish to say anything? You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.\" (b) It is only in exceptional cases that questions relating to an offence should be put to the accused person after he has been charged or informed that he may be prosecuted. Such questions may be put where they are necessary for the purpose of preventing or minimising harm or loss to some other person or to the public or for clearing up an ambiguity in a previous answer or statement. Before any such questions are put the accused should be cautioned in these terms— \"I wish to put some questions to you about the offence with which you have been charged (or about the offence for which you may be prosecuted). You are not obliged to answer any of these questions, but if you do the questions and answers will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.\" Any questions put and answers given relating to the offence must be contemporaneously recorded in full and the record signed by that person or if he refuses by the interrogating officer. Judges’ Rules High Court 49 LAWS OF GUYANA Cap. 3:02 [Subsidiary] L.R.O. 1/2012 (c) When such a person is being questioned, or elects to make a statement, a record shall be kept of the time and place at which any questioning or statement began and ended and of the persons present. IV. All written statements made after caution shall be taken in the following manner— (a) If a person says that he wants to make a statement he shall be told that it is intended to make a written record of what he says. He shall always be asked whether he wishes to write down himself what he wants to say; if he says that he cannot write or that he would like someone to write it for him, a police officer may offer to write the statement for him. If he accepts the offer the police officer shall, before starting, ask the person making the statement to sign, or make his mark to, the following— “I,......................................................wish to make a statement. I want someone to write down what I say. I have been told that I need not say anything unless I wish to do so and that whatever I say may be given in evidence.\" (b) Any person writing his own statement shall be allowed to do so without any prompting as distinct from indicating to him what matters are material. (c) The person making the statement, if he is going to write it himself, shall be asked to write out and sign before writing what he wants to say, the following— \"I make this statement of my own free will. I have been told that I need not say anything unless I wish to do so and that whatever I say may be given in evidence.\" (d) Whenever a police officer writes the statement, he shall take down the exact words spoken by the person making the statement, without putting any questions other Judges’ Rules 50 High Court LAWS OF GUYANA Cap. 3:02 [Subsidiary] L.R.O. 1/2012 than such as may be needed to make the statement coherent, intelligible and relevant to the material matters. He shall not prompt him. (e) When the writing of a statement by a police officer is finished the person making it shall be asked to read it and to make any corrections, alterations or additions he wishes. When he has finished reading it he shall be asked to write and sign or make his mark on the following Certificate at the end of the statement— \"I have read the above statement and I have been told that I can correct, alter or add anything I wish. This statement is true. I have made it of my own free will.\" (f) If the person who has made a statement refuses to read it or to write the above mentioned Certificate at the end of it or to sign it, the senior police officer present shall record on the statement itself and in the presence of the person making it, what has happened. If the person making the statement cannot read or refuses to read it, the officer who has taken it down shall read it over to him and ask him whether he would like to correct, alter or add anything and to put his signature or make his mark at the end. The police officer shall then certify on the statement itself what he has done. V. If at any time after a person has been charged with, or has been informed that he may be prosecuted for an offence a police officer wishes to bring to the notice of that person any written statement made by another person who in respect of the same offence has also been charged or informed that he may be prosecuted, he shall hand to that person a true copy of such written statement, but nothing shall be said or done to invite any reply or comment. If that person says that he would like to make a statement in reply, or starts to say something, he shall at once be cautioned or further cautioned Judges’ Rules High Court 51 as prescribed by Rule III(a). LAWS OF GUYANA Cap. 3:02 [Subsidiary] L.R.O. 1/2012 VI. Persons other than police officers charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders shall, so far as may be practicable, comply with these Rules.

(c) In writing down a statement, the words used should not be translated into \"official\" vocabulary; this may give a misleading impression of the genuineness of the statement.

So far as possible the particulars of the charge should be stated in simple language so that the accused Judges’ Rules 54 High Court LAWS OF GUYANA Cap. 3:02 [Subsidiary] L.R.O. 1/2012 person may understand it, but they should also show clearly the precise offence in law with which he is charged. Where the offence charged is a statutory one, it should be sufficient for the latter purpose to quote the section of the statute which created the offence. The written notice should include some statement on the lines of the caution given orally to the accused person in accordance with the Judges' Rules after a charge has been preferred. It is suggested that the form of notice should begin with the following words— \"You are charged with the offence(s) shown below. You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence\". (b) Once the accused person has appeared before the court it is not necessary to serve him with a written notice of any further charges which may be preferred. If, however, the police decide, before he has appeared before a court, to modify the charge or to prefer further charges, it is desirable that the person concerned should be formally charged with the further offence and given a written etc.. . . copy of the charge as soon as it is possible to do so having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. If the accused person has then been released on bail, it may not always be practicable or reasonable to prefer the new charge at once, and in cases where he is due to surrender to his bail within forty-eight hours or in other cases of difficulty it will be suffi¬cient for him to be formally charged with the further offence and served with a written notice of the charge after he has surrendered to his bail and before he appears before the court.","ordinal":99},{"doc_id":"act-003-02","chunk_id":"act-003-02-s7","section_number":"7","heading":"Facilities for defence","text":"(a) A person in custody should be allowed to speak on Judges’ Rules High Court 55 the telephone to his attorney-at-law or to his friends provided that no hindrance is reasonably likely to be caused to the pro- LAWS OF GUYANA Cap. 3:02 [Subsidiary] L.R.O. 1/2012 He should be supplied on request with writing materials and his letters should be sent by post or otherwise with the least possible delay.
