They may, however, include loans to, or guarantees of loans made to, national development banks or other suitable financial institutions, in order that the latter may finance development projects on terms approved by the Bank where the individual financing requirements of such projects are not, in the opinion of the Bank, large enough to warrant the direct supervision of the Bank. (b) The Bank shall not finance any undertaking in the territory of a member if that member objects to such financing. (c) Before a loan or guarantee is granted, the applicant shall have submitted an adequate loan or guarantee proposal and the President of the Bank shall have presented to the Board of Directors a written report regarding the proposal together with his recommendations on the basis of a staff study. (d) In considering an application for a loan or guarantee, the Bank shall pay due regard to the ability of the borrower to obtain LAWS OF GUYANA 22 Cap. 85:04 Caribbean Development Bank Agreement L.R.O. 1/2012 financing elsewhere on terms and conditions that the Bank considers reasonable for the recipient. (e) In making or guaranteeing a loan, the Bank shall pay due regard to the prospects that the borrower and its guarantor, if any, will be in a position to meet their obligations under the loan contract. (f) In making or guaranteeing a loan, the rate of interest, other charges and the schedule for repayment of principal shall be such as are, in the opinion of the Bank, appropriate for the loan concerned. (g) In guaranteeing a loan made by other investors, or in underwriting the sale of securities, the Bank shall receive suitable compensation for its risk. (h) The proceeds of financing in the ordinary operations of the Bank shall normally be used only for procurement, in territories of members, of goods and services produced in those territories. In special cases the Board of Directors may, however, determine the circumstances in which the procurement of goods and services may be permitted elsewhere, giving particular consideration wherever practicable to procurement of goods and services produced in the territory of countries which have contributed substantially to the resources of the Bank. (i) In procuring services, and in facilitating LAWS OF GUYANA Caribbean Development Bank Agreement Cap. 85:04 23 L.R.O. 1/2012 financing for entities or enterprises in the private sector, the Bank shall pay due regard to the need to develop and strengthen undertakings, entities and skills of individuals belonging to the region. (j) In the case of a direct loan made by the Bank, the borrower shall be permitted by the Bank to draw its funds only to meet expenditures in connection with the project as they are actually incurred. (k) The Bank shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the proceeds of any loan made, guaranteed, or participated in by the Bank are used only for the purposes for which the loan was granted and with due regard to considerations of economy and efficiency. (l) The Bank shall pay due regard to the desirability of a reasonable distribution of the benefits from its operations among the members in the region. (m) The Bank shall seek to maintain reasonable diversification in its investments in equity capital.
