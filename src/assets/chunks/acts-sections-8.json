pension to be recorded on marriage is found by adding together the two amounts calculated in accordance with Rule l(a) and (b) respectively. (a) Pension in consideration of the contributions paid during bachelorhood: Rule 1(a).

EXAMPLE If the particulars be as in the last preceding example, except that the wife born on 12th August, 1899, died on 30th November, 1927, it would be assumed that the contributor was, at the date of each of the three variations of contributions, married to a wife, still surviving, born on 12th August, 1899. The calculations would thus be identical with those in the last preceding example. (b) Variations of pension consequent on re-marriage of contributor: (i) If the second or subsequent wife was, at the date of the remarriage, of the same age last birthday as the last preceding wife would have reached had she survived to that date, there is no change in the pension. (ii) If the second or subsequent wife is, at the date of remarriage, of a less or greater age last birthday than the last preceding wife would have reached had she survived to that date, multiply the amount of the registered pension by the quantity found from table C for the age last birthday of the husband at the date of re- marriage and the age last birthday which the last preceding wife would have attained had she been still LAWS OF GUYANA Dependants’ Pension Cap. 27:08 61 L.R.O. 1/2012 surviving; and multiply the product by the quantity found from table A for the ages last birthday of the husband and second or subsequent wife at the date of re-marriage. The result gives the registered pension to be recorded on the remarriage of the contributor.

(c) Variations of pension consequent on increments to and decrements from current annual contribution during second marriage of contributor: Proceed as in rule 1 (c), B.—CONTRIBUTOR WHO COMMENCED TO CONTRIBUTE WHILE MARRIED III.—First wife’s prospective pension In every case of an officer who commenced to contribute while married, the wife at the date of commencement of contributions is to be considered as the officer’s first wife, and no particulars are to be recorded respecting any former wife to whom he may have been married, unless there be issue of the former wife of a pensionable age; as to whom see C of this part, rule 5. RULE 3 (a) Pension in consideration of the annual contribution current at the date of commencement of the contribution: Multiply the amount of the current annual contribution by the quantity found from table B for the respective ages of husband and wife at the date of commencement of contributions. The result is the registered pension required.

C.—CONTRIBUTOR WHO COMMENCED TO CONTRIBUTE WHILE A WIDOWER V.—Prospective pension to children by his first marriage So long as a contributor’s children by his first marriage are eligible for pension, a pension must be registered in their behalf. If there are no such children, the widower should be treated as if he were a bachelor. RULE 5 For the purpose of calculating the registered pension of the children assume that the deceased wife lived until the date of commencement of contribution and died immediately afterwards, and proceed in accordance with rule 3(a) and (b). VI.—Second and subsequent wife’s prospective pension RULE 6 For the purpose of calculating the registered pension of the wife assume that the deceased wife survived to the date of commencement of contribution and died immediately afterwards; then proceed in accordance with the rules applicable to the case of officers who commenced to contribute while married. LAWS OF GUYANA Dependants’ Pension Cap. 27:08 65 L.R.O. 1/2012 D.-CONTRIBUTOR WITH TWO OR MORE BENEFICIARIES RULE 7 Where there are children eligible for pension by two or more deceased wives, or where there is a wife, and there are also children eligible for pension by one or more previous marriages, the pension of each beneficiary as found by the above rules must be divided by the total number of beneficiaries then existing in order to find the registered pension of that beneficiary. N.B.-In applying this rule each group of children of pensionable age born of one deceased mother must be reckoned as a single beneficiary. E.-TREATMENT OF SURRENDER VALUES OF LIFE ASSURANCE POLICIES PAID OVER TO THE FUND RULE 8 (a) If the contributor is a bachelor or a widower with-out children of a pensionable age, the amount paid over to the fund should be accumulated as from date of payment and treated in accordance with rule I (a). (b) If the contributor is married, or a widower with children of a pensionable age, the amount paid should be multiplied by the quantity found from table A for the respective ages last birthday of the husband and wife at the date of the payment. If the contributor is a widower, assume that the deceased wife survived until the LAWS OF GUYANA 66 Cap. 27:08 Dependants’ Pension L.R.O. 1/2012 said date and died immediately thereafter. F.-CALCULATIONS FOR AGES NOT GIVEN IN THE TABLES The wife’s age in the tables is given at quinquennial intervals only. Ages of husbands and wives younger than the youngest, or older than the oldest, given in the tables are to be dealt with as if identical with the youngest and oldest there given respectively. For the intermediate ages of wives, interpolate by exact fifths. EXAMPLES For table A, husband and wife aged respectively 35 and 27 last birthday .35 and 25 = .359; 35 and 30 = .375. Difference .016. Add 3 of this to .359. Result .365. For table B, husband and wife aged respectively 30 and 24 last birthday .30 and 20 = 3.638; 30 and 25 = 3.785. Difference .147. Add 45 of this to 3.638. Result 3.755. For table C, husband and wife aged respectively 38 and 32 last birthday .38 and 30 = 2.862; 28 and 35 = 2.699. Difference .163. Deduct 2 of this from 2.862. Result 2.797. (Note that the process for table C is subtractive, not additive.) _________ LAWS OF GUYANA Dependants’ Pension Cap. 27:08 67 L.R.O. 1/ 2012 SUBSIDIARY LEGISLATION _________________ O.22/1974.
