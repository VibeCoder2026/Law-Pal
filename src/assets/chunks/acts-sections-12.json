(l) definition of death; (m) tissue transplantation related issues; (n) role of religion, and human rights; and (o) patients' charter of rights. Note 1. - Professional ethics are those principles that regulate the conduct between professionals and others with whom the professionals come in contact with in the course of their work. In the case of medical practitioners this usually refers to patients, colleagues and other health professionals, Government departments, statutory bodies, courts, employers and third party payers. Observance of these principles has always been considered important as sick or disabled persons and their relatives may be vulnerable to exploitation in their efforts to obtain a cure or relief from pain or suffering. Note 2, - (i) The Hippocratic Oath represented an early attempt to codify the principles mentioned in Note 1. Although the language is archaic and the concepts somewhat different from current verbal expressions, the Hippocratic Oath does contain the basic tenets of good practice and sound ethics which still guide modern medical practitioners. These are – (a) building on professional interrelationships; (b) documenting in good faith; (c) reproductive health; (d) avoiding unnecessary or unsafe LAWS OF GUYANA 36 Cap. 32:02 Medical Practitioners [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 International human rights instruments. Annexure II. treatment; and (e) avoiding improper relationships with patients or their dependents. (ii) Throughout the ages, the medical practitioners have considered it their duty to uphold these principles. The Medical Council has the statutory responsibility to uphold standards of professional conduct and competence, either by suspending or withdrawing the license of erring medical practitioners or by imposing any other penalty admissible under the Act. At the international level several bodies have attempted to codify what many medical practitioners generally regard as an obligation to, respect their patients' basic human rights. These are referred to as International Human Rights Instruments by the United Nations Commission for Human Rights and have been taken into consideration while making these Regulations. More importantly, in the course of their daily practice, the medical practitioners are often the first to become aware of abuse of human rights and therefore they should carry an even higher consciousness of what these rights represent.","ordinal":38},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s5","section_number":"5","heading":"Every medical practitioner   shall   make himself","text":"aware of the various abuses of human rights and become acquainted with the international human rights instruments listed in Annexure II.

(2) Where a medical practitioner indecently exposes himself to a patient while attending him professionally, the medical practitioner may render himself liable to criminal proceedings being proceeded against by the Medical Council for such action as a professional misconduct on preponderance of probability, even in the absence of a criminal conviction by a court of law. Note 1. - The Medical Council may take a serious view of a medical practitioner who uses his professional position in order to pursue a personal relationship of emotional or sexual nature with a patient or the close relative of a patient. Such abuse of a medical practitioner's professional position may be aggravated in a number of ways. For example, a medical practitioner may use the pretext of a professional visit to a LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 95 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . Professional confidentiality. patient's home to disguise his pursuit of a personal relationship with the patient (or, where the patient is a child, with the patient's parent) or he may use his knowledge, obtained in professional confidence, of the patient's marital difficulties to take advantage of that situation. But these are merely examples of particular situations. Note 2. - The trust which should exist between a medical practitioner and a patient can be severely damaged when, as a result of an emotional relationship between a medical practitioner and a patient, the family life of that patient is disrupted. This may occur even without sexual misconduct between the medical practitioner and patient. Note 3. - Note 2 refers to personal relationship between medical practitioners and their patients or the close relatives of patients and not with others. Note 4. - Innocent medical practitioners are put to inconvenience or are subjected to anxiety by unsolicited declarations of affection by patients or threats that a complaint will be made on the grounds of a relationship which existed only in the patient’s imagination. All complaints received by the Medical Council are, therefore, to be screened most carefully and action is to be taken only when the evidence received is sufficient to require investigation.","ordinal":92},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s59","section_number":"59","heading":"(1) Except in  the  cases mentioned  in  paragraph","text":"(3), it is a duty of a medical practitioner to strictly observe the rules of professional secrecy by refraining from disclosing voluntarily to any third party information about a patient, which he has learnt directly or indirectly in his professional capacity as a registered medical practitioner.

(3) The circumstances where exceptions to the rule of professional secrecy in respect of confidential information about a patient may be permitted are as follows – (a) if the patient or his legal adviser gives written and valid consent, information to which the consent refers may be disclosed; (b) confidential information may be shared with other registered medical practitioners who participate in or assume responsibility for clinical management of the patient to the extent that the medical practitioner deems it necessary for the performance of his particular duties; (c) confidential information may also be shared with other co-professionals such as nurses, radiologists and other health care professionals who are assisting and collaborating with the medical practitioner in his professional relationship with the patient and it is the medical practitioner's responsibility to ensure that such individuals appreciate that the information is being imparted in strict professional confidence; (d) if in particular circumstances the medical practitioner believes that it undesirable on medical grounds to LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 97 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . seek the patient's consent, information regarding the patient's health may sometimes be given in confidence to a close relative or a person in a similar relationship to the patient; (e) if in the medical practitioner's opinion disclosing of any information about a patient to a third party other than a relative, would be in the best interests of the patient, it is the medical practitioner's duty to make every reasonable effort to persuade the patient to allow the information to be given and if the patient still refuses to give his consent, then only in exceptional cases should the medical practitioner feel himself entitled to disregard the refusal of the patient; (f) information about a patient may be disclosed to the appropriate authority in order to satisfy a specific statutory requirement, such as notification of an infectious or contagious disease; (g) if the medical practitioner is directed to disclose information about a patient by a judge or other presiding officer of a court before whom he is appearing to give evidence, information may, at that stage, be disclosed; (h) information about a patient may also be disclosed to a coroner or his LAWS OF GUYANA 98 Cap. 32:02 Medical Practitioners [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 nominated representative to the extent necessary to enable the coroner to determine whether an inquest should be held; (i) where litigation is in prospect, unless the patient has consented to the disclosure or a formal court order has been made for disclosure, information about the patient should not be disclosed merely in response to demands from other persons such as another party's counsel or attorney-at- law or an official of the court without lawful authority of a court. (j) the disclosure may rarely be justified on the grounds that it is in the public interest or health of the community at large which, in certain circumstances such as, for example, investigation by the police of a grave or very serious crime, might override the medical practitioner's duty to maintain his patient's confidence; (k) information may also be disclosed if necessary for the purpose of a medical research project, which has been approved by a recognized Ethical Committee of the Medical Council. (4) A medical practitioner shall, always be prepared to justify his actions, if he has disclosed confidential information in respect of a patient. LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 99 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . (5) If a medical practitioner is in doubt as to whether any of the exceptions mentioned in this regulation would justify him in disclosing information in a particular situation he may seek advice from the Medical Council or a professional association. (6) Where an individual below the age of sixteen years consults a medical practitioner for medical advice or treatment, and is not accompanied at the consultation by a parent or a person in loco parentis, the medical practitioner should particularly have in mind the need to foster and maintain parental responsibility and family stability. (7) Before offering advice or treatment to any person, the medical practitioner shall satisfy himself, after careful assessment, that the individual has sufficient maturity and understanding to appreciate what is involved. (8) If a medical practitioner is satisfied as to the individual's maturity and ability to understand as set out in this regulation, he should nonetheless seek to persuade the individual, if a child to involve a parent, or another person in loco parentis, in the consultation and if the child nevertheless refuses to allow a parent or such other person to be told, the medical practitioner must decide, in the patient's best medical interests, whether or not to offer any advice or treatment. (9) If the medical practitioner is not so satisfied, he may decide to disclose the information learned from the consultation; but if he does so he should inform the patient accordingly, and his judgment concerning disclosure must always reflect both the patient's best medical interests and the trust the patient places in the medical practitioner. Note. - Special problems in relation to confidentiality of information relating to a patient can arise in circumstances LAWS OF GUYANA 100 Cap. 32:02 Medical Practitioners [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 where medical practitioners have responsibilities both to patients and to third parties, for example, in the practice of occupational medicine. (10) An occupational medical practitioner should ensure that any employee whom he examines or counsels in that capacity understands the duty of the occupational medical practitioner in relation to the employer and the purpose of the consultation. (11) Where an occupational medical practitioner is asked by the employer to assess the fitness of an employee to work he should not undertake such assessment except with the informed consent of the employee. (12) The extent to which disclosure of medical information after the death of a patient is regarded as improper shall depend on a number of factors such as – (a) the nature of the information disclosed; (b) the extent to which such information has already appeared in published material; (c) the circumstances of the disclosure, including the period which has elapsed since the patient's death. (13) If the Medical Council is unable to specify an interval of years to apply in all such cases mentioned in paragraph (12) and a medical practitioner who discloses such information without the consent of the patient or a surviving close relative of the patient may be required to justify his action. LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 101 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . (14) The provisions of these Regulations on confidentiality shall apply not only to information which a medical practitioner has received in a clinical relationship with a patient, but also information which he has received, either directly from the patient or indirectly, in the course of administrative or non-clinical duties, for example when employed by a public or private health authority, commercial firm, insurance company or other comparable organization, or as a medical author or medical journalist. (15) Where one medical practitioner shares confidential information with another medical practitioner, the interests of the patient require that the medical practitioner with whom the information is shared must observe the same rules of professional secrecy as the medical practitioner who originally obtained the information from the patient. (16) Every medical practitioner connected with organizations offering clinical diagnostic or medical advisory services shall satisfy himself that the organization discourages patients from approaching it without first consulting their own general medical practitioners. (17) In expressing the views, the Medical Council shall recognise and accept that in some areas of practice specialist and hospital clinics customarily accept patients referred by sources other than their general medical practitioners and in these circumstances also every specialist has the duty to keep the general medical practitioner informed.

(10) Every medical practitioner shall be cognizant of the disadvantages or negative impact of his self- promotional material.

(12) The advertising material should contain only factual information and shall not include any statement which could reasonably be regarded as misleading or as disparaging the services provided by other medical practitioners, whether directly or by implication.

PART VIII ADVICE ON HIV AND AIDS Note. - This Part deals with the guidance of the Medical Council on the ethical problems surrounding HIV and AIDS. It deals with the principles of the medical practitioner-patient relationship and the medical practitioner's duty towards patients. It also deals with specific matters, including the duties of medical practitioners who may themselves be infected and the need to obtain patients' consent to investigation or treatment. In all areas of medical practice, the medical practitioners are required to make judgments, which they may later have to justify. This is applicable both to clinical matters and complex ethical problems which arise regularly in the course of providing patient care because it is not possible to set out a code of practice which provides solutions to every such problem which may arise.","ordinal":110},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s77","section_number":"77","heading":"It is unethical for a medical practitioner –","text":"(a) to refuse treatment or investigation for which there are appropriate LAWS OF GUYANA 114 Cap. 32:02 Medical Practitioners [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 facilities on the ground that the patient suffers or may suffer from a condition which could expose the medical practitioner to personal risk; (b) to withhold treatment from any patient on the basis of a moral judgment that the behavior or lifestyle of the patient might have contributed to the condition for which the treatment was being sought. Note 1. - The relationship between a medical practitioner and his patients is founded on mutual trust, which can be fostered only when information is freely exchanged between the medical practitioner and his patients on the basis of honesty, openness and understanding. Acceptance of that principle is fundamental to the resolution of the questions which have been identified in relation to AIDS. Note 2. - The Medical Council has noted the significant increase in the understanding of AIDS and AIDS-related conditions, both within the medical profession and by the general public, which appears to have occurred. Although most medical practitioners are generally prepared to regard these conditions as similar in principle to other infections and life threatening conditions and are willing to apply established principles in approaching their diagnosis and management rather than treating them as medical conditions quite distinct from all others, the Medical Council has concern about the level of knowledge at the individual level about the management of the disease. Note 3. - The Medical Council expects that medical practitioners will extend to patients who are HIV positive or are suffering from AIDS the same high standard of medical LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 115 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . Duties of medical practitioners in certain HIV infected cases. care and support which they would offer to any other patient. The Medical Council has serious concern at reports of medical practitioners having refused or neglected to provide such patients with necessary care and treatment. Note 4. - It is entirely proper for a medical practitioner who has a conscientious objection to undertaking a particular course of treatment, or who lacks the necessary knowledge, skill or facilities to provide appropriate investigation or treatment for a patient, to refer that patient to a professional colleague.","ordinal":111},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s78","section_number":"78","heading":"(1) It is  unethical  for  a  medical  practitioner  who","text":"knows or believes himself to be infected with HIV to put patients at risk by failing to seek appropriate counselling or by failing to document it.

Note 1. - Considerable public anxiety has been aroused by suggestions that medical practitioners who are HIV positive might endanger their patients. The risk is very small. It is imperative, both in the public interest and on ethical grounds, that any medical practitioner suspected of being infected with HIV should seek appropriate diagnostic testing and counseling and, if found to be infected, have regular medical supervision. limit their practice in order to protect their patients.

Medical practitioners must document that advice which, in some circumstances, would include a requirement not to produce or to limit their practice in certain ways. No medical practitioner should continue in clinical practice merely on the basis of his own assessment of the risk to patients. This is intended to prevent the transmission of infection from medical practitioners to patients.","ordinal":112},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s79","section_number":"79","heading":"Medical  practitioners  who  become  infected  with","text":"HIV are entitled to expect the confidentiality and support afforded to other patients and only in the most exceptional circumstances, where the release of the name of the medical practitioner who is infected with HIV is essential for the protection of patients, may a medical practitioner's HIV status be disclosed without his consent.","ordinal":113},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s80","section_number":"80","heading":"A medical practitioner shall treat a patient only on","text":"the basis of consent of the patient, his parent or guardian either explicit or in unavoidable circumstances by implicit consent.

A patient's consent may in certain circumstances be given implicitly, for example, by agreement to provide a specimen of blood for multiple analysis. In other circumstances it needs to be given explicitly, for example, before undergoing a specified LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 117 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 .

As the expectations of patients, and consequently the demands made upon medical practitioners, increase and develop, it is essential that both medical practitioner and patient feel free to exchange information before investigation or before the treatment is undertaken.","ordinal":114},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s81","section_number":"81","heading":"(1) In the case of a patient presenting with certain","text":"symptoms, which the medical practitioner is expected to diagnose, the process of obtaining consent should form part of the consultation. (2) Where blood samples are taken for screening purposes, as in ante-natal clinics, there will usually be no reason to suspect HIV infection but even so the test should be carried out only where the patient has given explicit consent. Similarly, those handling blood samples in laboratories, either for specific investigation or for the purpose of research should test for the presence of HIV only where they know that the patient has given explicit consent. (3) Testing without explicit consent of a patient can be justified only in most exceptional circumstances where a test is imperative in order to secure the safety of persons other than the patient and it is not possible to obtain the prior consent of the patient. (4) It would not be unethical for a medical practitioner to perform a test without the patient's consent, provided that the medical practitioner is able to justify that documentation as being done in the best interests of the patient. conducting tests should apply generally, but it is particularly of having the consent of the patient for treatment and for Note 1. - The Medical Council has advised that the principle LAWS OF GUYANA 118 Cap. 32:02 Medical Practitioners [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 Confidentiality and HIV status. important in the case of testing for HIV infection, not because the condition is different in kind from other infections, but because of the possible serious \"social and financial consequences which may ensue for the patient from the mere fact of having been tested for the condition. These are problems which would be better resolved by developing a spirit of social tolerance than by medical action, but they do raise a particular ethical dilemma for the medical practitioner in connection with the diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS. They provide a strong argument for each patient to be given the opportunity, in advance, to consider the implications of submitting to such a test and deciding whether to accept or decline it. Note 2. - A particular difficulty arises in cases where it may be desirable to test a child for HIV infection and where, consequently, the consent of a parent, or a person in loco parentis, would normally be sought. However, the possibilities that the child having been infected by a parent may, in certain circumstances, distort the parent's judgment so that consent is withheld in order to protect the parent's own position. The medical practitioner faced with such a situation must first judge whether the child is competent to consent to the test on his own behalf. If the child is judged competent in this context, then, consent can be sought from the child. If, however, the child is judged unable to give consent, the medical practitioner must, decide whether the interest of the child should override the wishes of the parent.","ordinal":115},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s82","section_number":"82","heading":"(1) When a  patient  is  seen  by  a  specialist  who","text":"diagnoses HIV infection or AIDS, and a general practitioner is or may become involved in the care of the patient, then the specialist should explain to the patient that the general practitioner cannot be expected to provide adequate clinical management and care without full knowledge of the patient's condition. LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 119 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . Note - The medical practitioners are generally familiar with the need to make judgments as to whether confidential information should be disclosed or not in particular circumstances, and the need to justify their documentation where such a disclosure is made. The Medical Council has held the view that, where HIV infection or AIDS has been diagnosed, any difficulties concerning confidentiality which arise will usually be overcome if medical practitioners are prepared to discuss openly and honestly with patients the implication of their condition, the need to secure the safety of others, and the importance for continuing medical care of ensuring that those who will be involved in their care know the nature of their condition and the particular needs which they will have. The Medical Council has held the view that any medical practitioner who discovers that a patient is HIV positive or suffering from AIDS has a duty to discuss these matters fully with the patient. The Medical Council considers that the majority of the patients will readily be persuaded of the need for their general practitioners to be informed of the diagnosis. (2) If the patient refuses to consent to the specialist for giving full knowledge about his condition to the general practitioner, then the specialist has two sets of obligations to consider and these are the obligation to the patient to maintain confidence, and obligation to other care-givers whose own health may be put unnecessarily at risk. (3) In the circumstances mentioned in paragraph (2), the patient should be counseled about the difficulties which his condition is likely to pose for the team responsible for providing continuing health care and about the likely consequences for the standard of care which can be provided in the future. (4) If, having considered the matter carefully in LAWS OF GUYANA 120 Cap. 32:02 Medical Practitioners [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 Informing the patient’s spouse or other sexual partner. the light of such counseling, the patient still refuses to allow the general practitioner to be informed then the patient's request for privacy should be respected except where the medical practitioner judges that the failure to disclose the information would put the health of any member of the health care team at serious risk. Note. - The Medical Council considers that, in a situation mentioned in paragraph (4), it would not be improper to disclose such information, as that person needs to know. The need for such a decision is likely to arise only rarely, but if it is made, the medical practitioner must be able to justify his documentation. Similar principles apply to the sharing of confidential information between specialists or with other health care professionals such as nurses, laboratory technicians and dentists. All persons receiving such information must consider themselves under the same general obligation of confidentiality as the medical practitioner principally responsible for the patient's care should have.","ordinal":116},{"doc_id":"act-032-02","chunk_id":"act-032-02-s83","section_number":"83","heading":"(1) When a  person  is  found  to  be  infected  in  the","text":"manner specified in Note 1, the medical practitioner must discuss with the patient the question of informing a spouse or other sexual partner of the patient. (2) In case of AIDS patients, the medical practitioners shall make their own judgments of the course of action to be followed m specific circumstances. Note 1. - Questions of conflicting obligations also arise when a medical practitioner is faced with the decision whether the document that a patient is HIV positive or suffering from AIDS should be disclosed to a third party, other than another health care professional, without the consent of the patient. The Medical Council is of the view that there are grounds for LAWS OF GUYANA Medical Practitioners Cap. 32:02 121 [Subsidiary] Medical Practitioners (Code of Conduct and Standards of Practice) Regulations L.R.O. 1/2012 . Action on complaint against medical practitioners. such a disclosure only where there is a serious and identifiable risk to a specific individual who, if not so informed, would be exposed to infection. Note 2. - Medical Council considers that most patients with HIV positive or suffering from AIDs will agree to disclosure in the circumstances mentioned in Note 1, but where such consent is withheld the medical practitioner may consider it as his duty to ensure that any sexual partner is informed, in order to safeguard such person from infection. Note 3. - It is emphasized that the advice set out in this Part is intended to guide the medical practitioners in approaching the complex questions which may arise in the context of infections referred to in Note 1. The instructions in this Part may be taken as only general guidelines and individual medical practitioners must always be prepared, as a matter of good medical practice, to make their own reasonable judgments of the appropriate course of action to be followed in specific circumstances, and be able to justify the decisions which they make.
