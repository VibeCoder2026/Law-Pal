(1) Every elector shall have only one vote which shall be cast in the geographical constituency in which he is registered and votes in respect of the list of his choice, and that vote shall be counted to determine the outcomes of both the election for that geographical constituency and for the country taken as a whole: a vote for a Party’s geographical constituency list is simultaneously a vote for that Party’s national top-up list. (2) Within each geographical constituency, the seats allocated to a party for membership of the National Assembly from the geographical constituency shall be determined by application of the system of proportional representation to the valid votes cast in that geographical constituency in relation to the total number of seats being contested in that geographical constituency, thereby allocating to parties the twenty-five seats under section 11A (4). (3) Subject to the proviso to subsection (5) for the country taken as a whole, the total seats allocated to a party for membership of the National Assembly shall be determined by application of the system of proportional representation to the valid votes for parties countrywide in relation to the sixty-five elected seats of the National Assembly.
