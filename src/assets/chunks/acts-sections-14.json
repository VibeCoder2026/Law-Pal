The ebonite or fibre ring is secured in place by means of six small screws having their heads sunk below the surface of the ring, to avoid metallic contact between the bath and the oil cup.

Particular care shall be taken to avoid the presence of any gasoline or naphtha used to clean the apparatus after a previous test. (b) The cup shall be filled with the oil to be tested up to the level indicated by the filling mark. (c) The lid shall be placed on the cup and the latter set in the stove.

(d) The test flame shall be lighted and adjusted so that it is of the size of a bead A in. (4 mm.) in diameter. (e) Heat shall be supplied at such a rate that the temperature read on the thermometer increases not less than 9 nor more than 11 degrees per minute.

The regulations are based on the United States Coast Guard Code of Federal Regulations 46 Sub-Chapter T (certification of small passenger vessels) which are regarded as equivalent to IMO Convention requirements for such vessels, Sub-Chapter C (Uninspected vessels) and The United Kingdom Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Workboats and Pilot Boats. It should be noted that requirements for small commercial vessels of 24 metres and over in length, on international voyages, or those under 24 metres in length which carry more than 150 passengers or provide overnight accommodation for more than 50 passengers, are given in the Code of Safety for Caribbean Cargo Ships and the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended, (SOLAS) for cargo and passenger ships respectively. Nevertheless, small commercial vessels of 24 metres and over in length engaged on voyages in national waters only, could be allowed to operate under the provisions of this Code by the Administration. Administrations that are party to SOLAS, who notify IMO that the Code has been determined to be equivalent to the provisions of SOLAS under regulation 1/5, for passenger vessels of less than 24 metres in length on international voyages, can issue such vessels with a SOLAS Passenger Ship Safety Certificate along with a copy of the notification of equivalency to IMO.

(b) The test shall be conducted with all tanks 3/4 full, ballast aboard in place, all portlights secured, and any non-return valves or flaps on scuppers or deck drains restrained in the open position. (c) The vessel shall be fully afloat and all mooring are to be slack during the test. (d) During the loading and moving of test weights, care should be taken if there is evidence of low stability. This may be assumed to be the case whenever the effect of any added or shifted weight increment is noted to be more than that of the preceding increment of the same size, or when the chine or bilge amidships comes out of the water as a result of the heel.

(a) If the pendulum deflection DECREASES or remains unchanged —replace the cargo which was removed and complete the stability test procedure. (b) If the pendulum deflection INCREASES the cargo may be improving the stability of the vessel. Therefore, remove all of the cargo from the vessel, replace the test weights in their original positions so as to remove all list, re-measure the Reference Freeboard (f), and repeat the Twenty-Five Percent Test in its entirety for the new condition of loading. If the second Twenty-Five Percent Test indicates that the vessel will pass, complete the stability test procedure. (6) If the vessel passes the stability test procedure under these conditions, it is deemed to have adequate stability for the safe carriage of passengers allowed regardless of whether or not cargo, not in excess of the amount specified in item (2) above, is carried.

The specimen should not incorporate any of the edges of the one metre square panel. The edges of the specimen should be housed in a steel frame sufficiently to prevent them igniting during the tests. The specimen should be cured for at least 28 days before testing. 3 Test procedure The specimen should be oriented vertically in a draft free location, such that the tip of the blue flame, i.e. the point of greatest heat, impinges on the centre of the specimen with the flame normal to its surface. The non gel coat surface of the specimen should be exposed to the flame. The flame should not burn through the specimen within 15 minutes.
